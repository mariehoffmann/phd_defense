    abstract = {One major challenge in the design of highly multiplexed PCR primer sets is the large number of potential primer dimer species that grows quadratically with the number of primers to be designed. Simultaneously, there are exponentially many choices for multiplex primer sequence selection, resulting in systematic evaluation approaches being computationally intractable. Here, we present and experimentally validate Simulated Annealing Design using Dimer Likelihood Estimation (SADDLE), a stochastic algorithm for design of multiplex PCR primer sets that minimize primer dimer formation. In a 96-plex PCR primer set (192 primers), the fraction of primer dimers decreases from 90.7\% in a naively designed primer set to 4.9\% in our optimized primer set. Even when scaling to 384-plex (768 primers), the optimized primer set maintains low dimer fraction. In addition to NGS, SADDLE-designed primer sets can also be used in qPCR settings to allow highly multiplexed detection of gene fusions in cDNA, with a single-tube assay comprising 60 primers detecting 56 distinct gene fusions recurrently observed in lung cancer.},

    abstract = {Motivation: DNA metabarcoding is commonly used to infer the species composition of environmental samples, whereby a short, homologous DNA sequence is amplified and sequenced from all members of the community. Samples can comprise hundreds of organisms that can be closely or very distantly related. DNA metabarcoding combines polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), and sequences are taxonomically identified based on their match to a reference database. Ideally, each species of interest would have a unique DNA barcode. This short, variable sequence needs to be flanked by conserved regions that can be used as primer-binding sites. PCR primer pairs would amplify a variable barcode in a broad evolutionary range of taxa. To date, no tools exist that computationally search and analyze the effectiveness of new primer pairs for large unaligned sequence data sets. More specifically we solve the following problem: Given a set of reference sequences R = {R1, R2, ..., Rm}, find a primer set P that allows for a high taxonomic coverage. This goal can be achieved by filtering for frequent primers and ranking by coverage or variation, i.e. the number of unique barcodes for further analysis. Here we present the software PriSeT, an offline primer-discovery tool that is capable of processing large libraries and is robust against mislabeled or low-quality references. It avoids the construction of a multisequence alignment of R. Instead, PriSeT uses encodings of frequent k-mers that allow bit-parallel processing and other optimizations.Results: We first evaluated PriSeT on references (mostly 18S rRNA genes) from 19 clades covering eukaryotic organisms that are typical for freshwater plankton samples. PriSeT recovered several published primer sets as well as additional, more chemically suitable primer sets. For these new sets, we compared frequency, taxonomic coverage, and amplicon variation with published primer sets. For 11 clades we found de novo primer pairs that cover more taxa than the published ones, and for six clades de novo primers resulted in greater sequence (i.e., DNA barcode) variation. We also applied PriSeT to SARS-CoV-2 genomes and computed 114 new primer pairs with the additional constraint that the sequences have no co-occurrences in closely related taxa. These primer sets would be suitable for empirical testing.Availability: https://github.com/mariehoffmann/PriSeTContact: marie.hoffmann@fu-berlin.de},
